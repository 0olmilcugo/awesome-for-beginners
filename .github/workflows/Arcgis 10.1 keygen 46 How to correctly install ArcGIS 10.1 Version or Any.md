Single mode step index optical fibers are a type of optical fiber that can transmit light signals over long distances with minimal loss and distortion. They have a core with a uniform refractive index and a cladding with a lower refractive index. The core diameter is very small, typically around 9 micrometers, which allows only one mode of light to propagate. This reduces the effects of modal dispersion and chromatic dispersion, which can degrade the signal quality. Single mode step index optical fibers are widely used in telecommunications, fiber-optic sensors, and fiber lasers.
