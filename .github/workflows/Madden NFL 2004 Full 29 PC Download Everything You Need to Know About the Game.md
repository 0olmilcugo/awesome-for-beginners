## Step 1: Find a Reliable Source
 
The first step to download Madden NFL 2004 for PC full version is to find a reliable source that offers the game for free.

Some of them might contain viruses, malware, or unwanted software that can harm your computer or compromise your privacy.
 
One of the best sources that we recommend is My Abandonware[^1^], a website that hosts thousands of old games that are no longer sold or supported by their publishers.

## Step 2: Download the Game Files
 
Once you have found Madden NFL 2004 on My Abandonware, you can download the game files by clicking on the "Download" button. You will need to download two files: the ISO file and the original exe file. The ISO file is a disc image that contains all the data of the game. The original exe file is the executable file that launches the game.
 
The ISO file is about 912 MB in size, while the original exe file is about 4 MB in size. Depending on your internet speed, it might take some time to download both files. Make sure you have enough space on your hard drive before downloading them.
 
## Step 3: Mount the ISO File
 
After downloading both files, you will need to mount the ISO file on your computer. Mounting an ISO file means creating a virtual drive that acts as if you have inserted a physical disc into your computer. This way, you can access the game files without burning them onto a CD or DVD.
 
To mount an ISO file, you will need a software program that can handle disc images, such as Daemon Tools Lite[^2^]. Daemon Tools Lite is a free and easy-to-use program that lets you create and manage virtual drives on your computer. You can download Daemon Tools Lite from their official website and install it on your computer.
 
After installing Daemon Tools Lite, you can mount the ISO file by following these steps:
 
- Launch Daemon Tools Lite and click on the "Quick Mount" button at the bottom left corner of the window.
- Browse to the folder where you downloaded the ISO file and select it.
- A new virtual drive will appear on your computer with a letter assigned to it (such as D: or E:).
- You can now access the game files by opening the virtual drive in File Explorer.

## Step 4: Install and Run the Game
 
The final step to download Madden NFL 2004 for PC full version is to install and run the game. To do this, you will need to follow these steps:

- Open the virtual drive where you mounted the ISO file and double-click on the "Setup.exe" file.
- Follow the instructions on the screen to install the game on your computer. You will need to enter a serial key during the installation process. You can find a serial key in a text file called "Serial Key.txt" that you downloaded from My Abandonware along with the game files.
- After installing the game, copy and paste the original exe file that you downloaded from My Abandonware into the game folder where you installed it (usually C:\Program Files\ 8cf37b1e13
