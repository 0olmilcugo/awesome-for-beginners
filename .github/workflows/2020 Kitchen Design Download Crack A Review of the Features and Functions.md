### Tip 1: Choose a Template or Start from Scratch
 
When you launch the software, you will see a welcome screen that gives you the option to choose a template or start from scratch. Templates are pre-designed layouts that you can customize according to your preferences. They can save you time and effort by providing you with a basic structure and style for your design.
 
If you want to use a template, you can browse through the categories and select the one that suits your needs. You can also search for a specific template by typing a keyword in the search box. Once you have chosen a template, you can click on "Open" to load it into the software.
 
If you want to start from scratch, you can click on "New" to create a blank project. You will need to enter some basic information about your project, such as the name, dimensions, units, and style. You can also choose the default catalog that you want to use for your design.
 
### Tip 2: Add Walls, Doors, Windows, and Floors
 
The next step is to add the walls, doors, windows, and floors of your room. You can use the tools on the left side of the screen to draw and edit these elements. You can also use the "Room Wizard" tool to automatically generate a room based on your specifications.
 
You can adjust the size, shape, color, and texture of each element by using the properties panel on the right side of the screen. You can also add details such as moldings, baseboards, trims, and outlets by using the "Accessories" tool.
 
### Tip 3: Add Cabinets, Appliances, Fixtures, and Accessories
 
The most fun part of designing a kitchen or bathroom is adding the cabinets, appliances, fixtures, and accessories. You can access thousands of products from manufacturer catalogs or import your own models from SketchUp by using the "Items" tool.
 
You can drag and drop the items into your design and place them where you want them. You can also resize, rotate, move, copy, delete, and align them by using the tools on the top of the screen. You can also customize each item by changing its color, material, style, hardware, lighting, and more by using the properties panel.
 
### Tip 4: Add Finishing Touches
