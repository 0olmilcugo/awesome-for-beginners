If you are taking a first course in numerical methods, you may encounter a problem like this: how to solve a system of nonlinear equations using Newton's method? In this article, we will explain what Newton's method is, how it works, and how to apply it to a system of nonlinear equations. We will also show you the solution to problem 125 from the textbook "A First Course in Numerical Methods" by Ascher and Greif.

## What is Newton's Method?
  
Newton's method is a numerical technique for finding the roots of a function, that is, the values of x that make f(x) = 0. It is based on the idea of using a linear approximation of the function at a given point, and then finding the intersection of that line with the x-axis. This intersection gives us a better approximation of the root than the original point. We can then repeat this process until we reach a desired level of accuracy.
  
The formula for Newton's method is:

$$x\_n+1 = x\_n - \fracf(x\_n)f'(x\_n)$$
  
where $x\_n$ is the current approximation of the root, $f(x\_n)$ is the function value at that point, $f'(x\_n)$ is the derivative of the function at that point, and $x\_n+1$ is the next approximation of the root.
  
## How to Apply Newton's Method to a System of Nonlinear Equations?
  
Sometimes, we need to solve a system of nonlinear equations, that is, a set of equations that involve more than one variable and are not linear. For example:
  
$$\begincases f\_1(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0 \\ f\_2(x,y) = x^3 - y = 0 \endcases$$
  
This system has two unknowns, x and y, and two equations. To find the solutions, we need to find the values of x and y that make both equations true.
  
One way to do this is to use Newton's method in a multidimensional setting. The idea is similar to the one-dimensional case, but instead of using a line to approximate the function, we use a plane. The formula for Newton's method in two dimensions is:
  
$$\beginbmatrix x\_n+1 \\ y\_n+1 \endbmatrix = \beginbmatrix x\_n \\ y\_n \endbmatrix - J^-1(x\_n,y\_n) \beginbmatrix f\_1(x\_n,y\_n) \\ f\_2(x\_n,y\_n) \endbmatrix$$
  
where $J^-1(x\_n,y\_n)$ is the inverse of the Jacobian matrix of the system at $(x\_n,y\_n)$. The Jacobian matrix is a matrix that contains the partial derivatives of each equation with respect to each variable. For example:
  
$$J(x,y) = \beginbmatrix \frac\partial f\_1\partial x & \frac\partial f\_1\partial y \\ \frac\partial f\_2\partial x & \frac\partial f\_2\partial y \endbmatrix = \beginbmatrix 2x & 2y \\ 3x^2 & -1 \endbmatrix$$
  
To apply Newton's method to a system of nonlinear equations, we need to do the following steps:
  
1. Choose an initial guess for the solution, $(x\_0,y\_0)$.
2. Calculate the function values and the Jacobian matrix at the current guess.
3. Invert the Jacobian matrix using any suitable method (such as Gaussian elimination).
4. Calculate the next guess using the formula above.
5. Check if the new guess is close enough to the true solution (using some error criterion).
6. If not, repeat steps 2-5 until convergence 8cf37b1e13
