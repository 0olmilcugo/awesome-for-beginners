Plus 2D Nesting Software also allows you to control the quality and speed of the optimization, with an intuitive slider bar. You can choose between fast and simple layouts or slow and complex layouts, depending on your preference and need. You can also adjust the level of part rotation, which can affect the material utilization and cutting time.
 
Plus 2D Nesting Software is compatible with most of the CNC cutting machines and controllers. It can export the layout drawings as DXF files with information on different layers, which you can import into your cutting table link software. It can also write out the data in standard formats, such as ISO G-code, ESSI, etc. If your CNC controller is not supported, you can contact the developers and they will try to add it to the list.
