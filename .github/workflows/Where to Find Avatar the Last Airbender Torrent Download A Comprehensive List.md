Avatar: The Last Airbender is not just a kids' show. It is a masterpiece of storytelling, animation and worldbuilding that appeals to people of all ages and backgrounds. Here are some of the reasons why Avatar: The Last Airbender is a great show:

1. **It has a rich and diverse world.** The world of Avatar: The Last Airbender is inspired by various Asian cultures and mythologies. It has four nations based on the four elements: the Air Nomads, the Water Tribes, the Earth Kingdom and the Fire Nation. Each nation has its own history, culture, politics and spirituality. The show also explores the concept of bending, the ability to manipulate one of the four elements with martial arts movements. Bending is not just a cool power, but a reflection of one's personality and philosophy.
2. **It has a complex and compelling plot.** The show follows Aang's journey to master all four elements and stop the Fire Nation's war against the other nations. Along the way, he faces many challenges, enemies and allies. The show does not shy away from tackling serious themes, such as war, genocide, oppression, betrayal, redemption and destiny. The show also has many twists and turns that keep the viewers hooked and surprised.
3. **It has a memorable and diverse cast of characters.** The show has a large and diverse cast of characters, each with their own personality, backstory and development. Aang is a cheerful and optimistic boy who struggles with his responsibility as the Avatar. Katara is a compassionate and determined waterbender who becomes Aang's mentor and friend. Sokka is a sarcastic and resourceful warrior who provides comic relief and strategy. Toph is a blind and rebellious earthbender who teaches Aang how to see with his feet. Zuko is a conflicted and honorable firebender who pursues Aang to restore his honor. Iroh is a wise and humorous firebender who guides Zuko on his path to redemption. These are just some of the main characters, but there are many more that are equally interesting and important.

Avatar: The Last Airbender is a show that deserves all the praise and recognition it gets. It is a show that transcends its genre and medium, and delivers a powerful and meaningful message about balance, harmony and peace.
