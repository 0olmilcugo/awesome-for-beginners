# Production Line : Car Factory Simulation - A Game Review
 
Production Line : Car Factory Simulation is a game developed by Positech Games and released on Steam in 2019. The game is a strategy and management simulation that challenges players to design and run their own car factory, competing with other manufacturers and optimizing their production line for maximum efficiency and profit.
 
The game is inspired by the assembly line revolution pioneered by Henry Ford, who invented a system of dividing a complex task (such as building a car) into smaller, simpler and more defined tasks that could be performed by specialized machines and workers. This system reduced the cost and time of car production, and made cars more affordable and accessible to the masses.

In Production Line : Car Factory Simulation, players start with a small factory and a limited budget, and have to research new technologies, design new car models, build new facilities, hire and train staff, manage supply chains, set prices and marketing strategies, and deal with customer feedback and market trends. The game offers a lot of depth and customization options, allowing players to create their own unique car brands and factory layouts.
 
The game also features realistic graphics and sound effects, simulating the busy and noisy environment of a car factory. The game has a sandbox mode where players can experiment with different scenarios and settings, as well as a campaign mode where players have to complete specific objectives and challenges. The game also supports modding, allowing players to create and share their own content with the community.
 
Production Line : Car Factory Simulation is a game that appeals to the efficiency geek in all of us, the person who cannot help but organize things for maximum performance. The game is also suitable for fans of strategy, simulation and tycoon games, as well as car enthusiasts who want to learn more about the history and mechanics of car production. The game is available on Steam for $24.99 USD[^4^], or in a bundle with two DLCs (Doors that go like this and Design Variety Pack) for $31.47 USD[^4^].

The game is not easy to master, and players may need some tips and tricks to improve their performance and efficiency. Here are some of the best tips and tricks for playing Production Line : Car Factory Simulation:
 
- Research new technologies as soon as possible. Researching new technologies will unlock new car features, production slots, upgrades and improvements that will give you an edge over your competitors and increase your profits. You can access the research screen from the top left icon on the screen.
- Optimize your production line layout. A good production line layout will minimize the distance and time between each production slot, reduce congestion and bottlenecks, and make use of every available space. You can move or delete existing slots by using the right-click menu on them. You can also use conveyor crossings, underpasses and smart junctions to create more complex and efficient layouts.
- Use supply stockpiles and local suppliers. Supply stockpiles are special tiles that act as buffers for resources that are frequently used by nearby production slots. They can reduce the dependency on the overhead conveyor system and speed up production. Local suppliers are small factories that produce certain components on-site, such as tires, seats or windows. They can reduce the import costs and increase the reliability of your supply chain.
- Upgrade your production slots. Production slots can be upgraded with various enhancements that can improve their speed, quality, efficiency or reliability. Upgrades can be purchased from the slot details window that appears when you click on a slot. Some upgrades require certain research to be unlocked first.
- Adjust your car prices and marketing strategies. Car prices can be set individually for each car model from the car design screen that can be accessed from the top left icon on the screen. You can also set a base price for all models from the finance screen that can be accessed from the top right icon on the screen. Car prices affect the demand and profitability of your cars, so you need to balance them carefully. Marketing strategies can be launched from the marketing screen that can be accessed from the top right icon on the screen. Marketing campaigns can boost the awareness and appeal of your cars, but they also cost money and have a limited duration.
