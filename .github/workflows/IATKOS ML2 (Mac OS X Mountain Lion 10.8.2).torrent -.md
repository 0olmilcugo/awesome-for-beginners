After you have burned iATKOS ML2 to a DVD or USB drive, you are ready to install it on your PC. Before you do that, you need to make some changes in your BIOS settings to enable booting from the DVD or USB drive and disable some features that may cause problems with the installation.

- Disable VT-d (Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O)

- Enable Legacy Boot
- Set Boot Priority to DVD or USB drive

The exact steps and names of these settings may vary depending on your motherboard model and BIOS version. Refer to your motherboard manual for more details.
