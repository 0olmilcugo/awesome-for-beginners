3 Telugu Movie is a film that explores the highs and lows of love, life, and death. It is a film that will make you laugh, cry, and think. It is a film that will stay with you long after it ends.
  
3 Telugu Movie was released on March 30, 2012, and faced competition from other big releases like Racha and Dammu. The film opened to a decent response at the box office, collecting around 6.5 crores on its first day. However, the film's collections dropped drastically in the following days, due to negative word-of-mouth and poor reviews.
 
The film's total worldwide gross was estimated to be around 40 crores, which was much lower than its budget of 22 crores. The film was declared a flop at the box office, and failed to recover its production and distribution costs. The film's poor performance was attributed to its weak second half, confusing screenplay, and lack of commercial elements.
 
3 Telugu Movie is a film that had a lot of potential, but failed to live up to it. It is a film that tried to be different, but ended up being disappointing. It is a film that had some memorable moments, but also many forgettable ones.
