By following this tutorial, you will be able to create your own 20th Century Fox logo animation in less than an hour. You will also learn some useful tips and tricks for working with AETuts and Cinema 4D. So let's get started!
  
## Step 1: Download and Import the Project Files
 
The first step is to download the project files from the AETuts website. You can find them here: [AETuts 20th Century Fox - After Effect And Maxon Cinema 4D Project Files](https://freestylercrew.forumotion.com/t77-aetuts-20th-century-fox-after-effect-and-maxon-cinema-4d-project-files) [^1^]. The project files include two folders: one for After Effects and one for Cinema 4D. You will need both software installed on your computer to follow this tutorial.
 
After downloading the project files, unzip them and open the After Effects folder. You will see a file named "20th Century Fox.aep". Double-click on it to open it in After Effects. You will see a composition named "Main Comp" in the project panel. This is where you will work on the logo animation.
 
In the Main Comp, you will see a layer named "C4D". This is a special layer that links to the Cinema 4D file. If you select this layer and press U on your keyboard, you will see two expressions in the timeline panel. These expressions control the camera and light settings of the Cinema 4D file. You don't need to worry about them for now.
  
## Step 2: Customize the Text and Colors of the Logo
 
The next step is to customize the text and colors of the logo. To do this, you need to open the Cinema 4D file that is linked to the C4D layer. To open it, select the C4D layer and go to Edit > Edit Original. This will launch Cinema 4D and open the file named "20th Century Fox.c4d".
 
In Cinema 4D, you will see a scene with several objects and lights. The objects are grouped into three null objects: Logo, Spotlight, and Background. The Logo null object contains the text and extrusion of the logo. The Spotlight null object contains a spotlight that illuminates the logo. The Background null object contains a plane that serves as the background.
 
To change the text of the logo, select the Logo null object and expand it. You will see two text objects: one for "20th" and one for "Century Fox". To edit them, double-click on them and type your desired text in the Attributes panel. You can also change the font, size, alignment, and kerning of the text.
 
To change the colors of the logo, select the Logo null object and expand it again. You will see two materials: one for "20th" and one for "Century Fox". To edit them, double-click on them and adjust the color, reflection, specular, and luminance settings in the Material Editor. You can also drag and drop new materials from the Content Browser or create your own materials from scratch.
