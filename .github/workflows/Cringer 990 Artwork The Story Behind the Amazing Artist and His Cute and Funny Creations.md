If you want to create your own cringer 990 artwork, you will need some basic skills in Photoshop or a similar software. You will also need some reference images of cyberpunk scenes, characters, and objects. You can find plenty of them on sites like [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/), [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/), or [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/).
  
Here are some general steps to follow:

1. Create a new document with a dark background color.
2. Add a photo of a cityscape or an industrial environment as the base layer. Adjust the brightness, contrast, color balance, and perspective to match your desired mood.
3. Add another photo of a character or an object as the main focus of your artwork. Cut out the unwanted parts using the lasso tool or the pen tool. Resize and position it according to your composition.
4. Add some cybernetic enhancements or gadgets to your character or object using photos or brushes. You can also use the liquify tool or the warp tool to modify the shape and appearance.
5. Add some neon lights and glows to your artwork using the brush tool or the gradient tool. Choose bright colors like pink, blue, green, or yellow. You can also use layer styles like outer glow or inner glow to create more effects.
6. Add some text or logos to your artwork using the text tool or the custom shape tool. Choose fonts that are futuristic, bold, or distorted. You can also use layer styles like drop shadow or bevel and emboss to create more depth.
7. Add some noise, grain, scratches, or glitches to your artwork using filters or textures. This will give your artwork a more realistic and gritty look.
8. Save your artwork as a JPEG or PNG file with high quality.

Of course, these are just some basic guidelines. You can experiment with different techniques, tools, and effects to create your own unique style of cringer 990 artwork. The most important thing is to have fun and express yourself!
