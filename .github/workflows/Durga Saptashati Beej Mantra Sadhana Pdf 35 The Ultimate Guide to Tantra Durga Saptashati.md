## Steps to Perform Durga Saptashati Beej Mantra Sadhana
 
1. Choose a suitable time and place for the sadhana. Ideally, it should be done during Navratri, the nine nights of the Goddess, or on any auspicious day like Ashtami, Chaturdashi, or Purnima. The place should be clean, quiet, and free from distractions.
2. Prepare a sacred altar with an image or idol of Goddess Durga, a lamp, incense, flowers, fruits, sweets, and water. You can also keep a copy of Durga Saptashati and a rosary of rudraksha or crystal beads.
3. Take a bath and wear clean clothes. Sit on a mat facing east or north. Light the lamp and incense. Offer flowers, fruits, sweets, and water to Goddess Durga. Pray to her with devotion and sincerity.
4. Chant the following invocation mantra 108 times:

`Om Aim Hreem Kleem Chamundaye Vichche Namah`

This mantra is a combination of the beej mantras of Goddess Durga and her various forms. It means "Salutations to the Goddess who is the slayer of demons and who is endowed with intelligence, power, beauty, and compassion."
5. Start reciting the Durga Saptashati along with the beej mantras. You can either read from a book or listen to an audio recording. The beej mantras are given below each verse in brackets. For example:

`Om Namo Devyai Mahadevyai Shivayai Satatam Namah (Om Aim Hreem Kleem Chamundaye Vichche)`

This verse means "Salutations to the Goddess who is the great Goddess, who is auspiciousness itself, and who is always worshipped."
6. Continue reciting the Durga Saptashati until you complete all the 13 chapters and 700 verses. It may take several hours to finish the entire text. You can take breaks in between if needed.
7. After completing the Durga Saptashati, chant the following concluding mantra 108 times:

`Om Sarva Mangala Mangalye Shive Sarvartha Sadhike Sharanye Tryambake Gauri Narayani Namostute (Om Aim Hreem Kleem Chamundaye Vichche)`

This mantra means "Salutations to the Goddess who is the source of all auspiciousness, who is benevolent to all, who is the refuge of all, who has three eyes, who is fair complexioned, and who is Narayani."
8. Thank Goddess Durga for her blessings and grace. Express your gratitude and love for her. Ask for her forgiveness for any mistakes or shortcomings in your sadhana. Request her to fulfill your wishes and protect you from all harm.
9. Distribute the prasad (offering) among your family members or friends. You can also donate some food or money to the needy or a temple in the name of Goddess Durga.
