ServiceTool V2000exe is a software program that allows you to perform various service mode operations on some Canon printers. You can use it to reset the ink absorber counter, print test patterns, check the ink level, change the region code, and more. However, you need to be careful when using this tool, as it may cause damage to your printer if you don't follow the instructions correctly.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use ServiceTool V2000exe to reset the ink absorber counter on your Canon printer. This is a common problem that occurs when the printer has reached a certain number of prints and the waste ink pad is full.

To fix this, you need to enter the service mode and run the ServiceTool V2000exe program.

## Step 1: Download ServiceTool V2000exe
 
You can download ServiceTool V2000exe from various online sources, such as [PrinterKnowledge](https://www.printerknowledge.com/threads/canon-service-tool-v2000.6615/) [^1^], [Elektroda](https://www.elektroda.com/rtvforum/topic2284272.html) [^2^], or [Files.Elektroda](https://files.elektroda.pl/689094,canon_service_tool_s_.html) [^4^]. Make sure you download the correct version for your printer model and software version. The program works with Windows XP only, so you may need to use a compatible computer or a virtual machine if you have a newer operating system.
 
## Step 2: Enter the service mode
 
Before running the ServiceTool V2000exe program, you need to put your printer into the service mode. This is a special mode that allows you to access the internal settings of the printer. The procedure for entering the service mode may vary depending on your printer model and software version, so check your printer manual or online guides for details. Here is an example of how to enter the service mode on a Canon MP540 printer:
 
1. Turn off the printer (not from the power supply, just press the power off button).
2. Press and hold the Stop button, then press and hold the ON button. (Do not release the buttons).
3. When the Power LED lights in green, release the Stop button but keep holding the ON button.
4. Press the Stop button twice, then release both buttons. (Each time you press the Stop button, the Alarm and Power LEDs will light alternately in orange and green).
5. When the Power LED lights in green, the printer is ready for the service mode operation. The LCD display will show two lines of text: 1: Service mode and 2: Idle.

Note: No other printers should be connected to the computer while entering the service mode. Also, make sure that both cassette and rear tray contain paper, as some service mode operations may require printing.
