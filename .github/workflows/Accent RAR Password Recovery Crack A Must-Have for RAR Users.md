# How to Crack RAR Passwords with Accent RAR Password Recovery
 
If you have forgotten or lost the password of a RAR/WinRAR archive, you may want to crack it using a tool like Accent RAR Password Recovery. This is a commercial product that claims to have high speed of brute force attack, versatile range customization, and GPU acceleration on NVIDIA and/or AMD graphics cards[^1^]. However, cracking a RAR password is not easy and may take a long time depending on the complexity of the password. In this article, we will show you how to use Accent RAR Password Recovery to crack a RAR password and also some alternative methods that may work better.
 
## Steps to Crack a RAR Password with Accent RAR Password Recovery
 
1. Download and install Accent RAR Password Recovery from its official website[^1^]. You can try the free demo version that allows you to test all its features, but it can only recover passwords up to four characters long. To crack longer passwords, you need to purchase a license.
2. Launch the program and click on the Open button to select the RAR file you want to crack. You can also drag and drop the file into the program window.
3. Choose the attack type from the Attack tab. There are four types of attacks: brute force, mask, dictionary, and hybrid. Brute force tries all possible combinations of characters until it finds the password. Mask allows you to specify some known parts of the password, such as length, case, or symbols. Dictionary uses a list of words or phrases as possible passwords. Hybrid combines dictionary and mask attacks.
4. Configure the attack settings according to your needs. For example, you can set the character set, the password length range, the mutation rules, or the dictionary file. You can also enable GPU acceleration if you have a supported graphics card.
5. Click on the Start button to begin the cracking process. The program will display the progress, speed, and estimated time of completion. You can pause or stop the process at any time.
6. Once the password is found, the program will show it in a pop-up window. You can also view it in the Log tab or copy it to the clipboard.
7. Use the recovered password to open your RAR file with any compatible program.

- Use a command-line tool like cRARk[^2^] that can run on Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X. This tool uses brute force or dictionary attacks and supports GPU acceleration as well. To use it, you need to download it from its website and extract it to a folder. Then open a command prompt window and navigate to that folder. Type crark yourarchivename.rar and press Enter to crack the password. Replace yourarchivename.rar with the name of the RAR file you want to crack. This will start the process of cracking the password using the definitions you specified. Once the password is cracked, you'll see the password followed by CRC OK.

To use it, you need to upload your RAR file to their website and enter your email address. They will send you an email with the password if they find it in their database.

You can also try some personal information related to the owner of the file, such as their name, birthday, pet name, or favorite movie. Alternatively, you can send an email or a message pretending to be someone else and ask for the password politely.
